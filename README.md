I created this app as a part of Udacity scholarship for Android, to improve my skill in XML, Java and using GoogleApiClient.

By using the buttons, user can choose to request or stop getting updates of current activity.

Creating this app improved my skills in using GoogleApiClient, IntentService and getting user's current activity.
